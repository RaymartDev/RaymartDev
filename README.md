# About Me

I'm 21 years old, currently residing at Philippines. I'm currently studying just for the piece of paper that will lead me to a job. But I've been programming java for 8 years now, 4 years for professionalism and 4 years for a hobby.

This is just my new github, and this is what I use for game plugin materials:
* [_PandaDevX Github_](https://github.com/PandaDevX)

I want to save all of my project here that is not game related.

You can contact me at. raymart.sarmiento23@outlook.com

I am currently studying, BS Computer Science.

# Languages that I plan to study

* Python
* PHP
* Django ( Python Framework )
* JavaScript
